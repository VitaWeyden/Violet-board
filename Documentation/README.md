## Important Information

* Wishlist items and shopping cart contents are stored in the session for guest users and are automatically transferred to the user's account upon login.
* Product prices are automatically generated during seeding based on the game's weight and do **not** represent real prices.
* Box Collect locations are defined in the `config/box_collect_locations.php` file.
* Discounts and the `New` / `Bestseller` labels are assigned to products during the seeding process.
* Orders are stored in the database after checkout; however, no real payment gateway integration has been implemented.
